# This assingment was pretty tough for me
# I think one of the hardest things is just trying to rememeber all of
# the code and what it all does.
# The page is somewhat boring but I am okay with that right now,
# because I am still just trying to learn the basis before I jump in too
# far and get in above my head.
# So far this is one of my most time consuming classes just because it can be
# very frustrating trying to remember everything and if you mess up just a
# little it messes up everything and you have to try to find out what you did
# wrong.
# However the cheat sheets provided help a lot so does the website and all the
# examples. If I didn't have the examples to play around with I would be so lost!
# I am starting to get the hang of things a bit better than in previous weeks
# but I still get frustrated here and there, which is both annnoying and something
# that I love, because I do love being challenged and learning new things.
# It just amazes me everyday how much goes into technology and we are only
# skimming the surface with this class!
# Staying organized is something that I have learned is very important for this
# class, and trying to memorize the code and learn what it all does and use it
# correctly. I appreciate the webiste and all the examples and the cheat sheets
# however! Without them I would so lost and in tears! YAY for completing this
# assignment!
